            <tr>
                <td class="article-content">As of November 25, 2025, 50 new boot units were added this week, bringing the total inventory to 2,935 items according to the Saturday evening inventory snapshot.

These figures are based on the diverse range of boots available, with variances depending on specific models and brands. For example, purchasing 10 units could yield around $1,343 in gross profit potential, making this category an attractive option for resellers focused on price spread opportunities rather than speculation. Looking at the three-year seasonal trend, the market holds a strong position as a leader in boot liquidation. The pulse shows a rise in activity during October, followed by a typical dip in November. This pattern reflects the Black Friday Blitz strategy, known in the industry as "The BIG ONE," where inventory peaks in November before moving rapidly through the holiday sales window.
